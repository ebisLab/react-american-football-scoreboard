#### What is ReactJS
User Interface Component Library to build out UI. 
Built by FB to help solve and manage data in a complex state
It is not a framework, but a library that renders UI. 
The components aspect to it upon further research and experience helps organize the code into different sections so that when it is reused or we go back to add on to it, we don't have to swift through a long line of code just to get to the section. 

*Features --> When the state changes, the component re-renders

##### Use State
it's a function - also known as component state
